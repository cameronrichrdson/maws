Welcome to the code space for the Modular Autonomous Water Sampler (MAWS)! This repository hosts all the code necessary to operate the MAWS, including calibration files for the conductivity sensor and the real-time clock (RTC). Please follow the instructions below to successfully operate the MAWS. The code is by no means beautiful, but it works!

1. Download the following files: 'conductivity.ino', 'set_clock.ino', and 'control.ino'
2. Download the user manual: 'V1_MAWS Software User Guide.pdf'
